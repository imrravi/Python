# Final Project: Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

### Objective
This project involves analyzing an electric vehicle (EV) dataset to:
- Filter and segment data
- Detect outliers
- Explore relationships using data visualization
- Create an EV recommendation engine
- Conduct hypothesis testing

### Tasks Summary

1. Filter EVs based on price and range, grouped by manufacturer
2. Identify outliers in energy consumption
3. Analyze relationship between battery capacity and driving range
4. Create a class to recommend EVs based on user input
5. Perform a t-test to compare engine power between Tesla and Audi
6. Include a 5-minute video walkthrough of the project

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical analysis & visualization
